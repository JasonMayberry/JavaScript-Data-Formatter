# JavaScript-Data-Formatter
The Generate Items button defines the number of data fields(wide) you wish your table to be. Tab moves from left to right. Shift+Tab moves from right to left. New rows the same width are added by the Add Row button or by pressing the alt key. New rows of a different width can be added at any time by pressing the Generate Items button.  When creating a .csv that has a comma in the data, follow this pattern: ,one value,"single,value",another value, Copy pasting .csv files to html editors like Visual-Studio-Code or Atom may transfer unwanted line ending types. Use a truly plain text editor for that like Sublime-Text, NotePad or NotePad++.
